First, we check for the shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 15 using the A* Search algorithm.
#:	From:	To:	Weight:

1:	0, 	2, 	Weight = 10
2:	2, 	6, 	Weight = 8
3:	6, 	9, 	Weight = 6
4:	9, 	15, 	Weight = 15

Next, we check for the shortest path from vertex 0 to vertex 15 using Dijkstra's algorithm to verify our results.
